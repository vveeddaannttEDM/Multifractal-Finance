# Multifractal Analysis of Financial Volatility

This project implements the multifractal analysis of financial time series inspired by the paper *Direct Evidence for Inversion Formula in Multifractal Financial Volatility Measure* by Zhi-Qiang Jiang and Wei-Xing Zhou. The goal is to verify the inversion formula in financial markets using high-frequency S&P 500 data.
